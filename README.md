## Role-Based Access Control

### ADMIN
- Create users
- View all users
- Create payments
- View all payments
- Update payments
- Delete payments

### FINANCE_MANAGER
- Create payments
- View all payments
- Update own payments
- View own payments

### VIEWER
- View all payments
- View own payments

---

## Testing with Postman/cURL

### 1. Login to get JWT token

### 2. Create a payment

### 3. Get all payments
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

---

## Error Handling

The API provides comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages:

- **400 Bad Request:** Validation errors
- **401 Unauthorized:** Invalid credentials
- **403 Forbidden:** Insufficient permissions
- **404 Not Found:** Resource not found
- **500 Internal Server Error:** Server errors

---

## Configuration

### JWT Configuration
- Secret key: Configurable in `application.properties`
- Token expiration: 24 hours (configurable)

### Database Configuration
- Connection pool configuration
- Hibernate DDL auto-update
- SQL logging for development

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Encryption:** All passwords are encrypted using BCrypt
2. **JWT Security:** Tokens are signed and validated
3. **Role-based Access:** Method-level security annotations
4. **Input Validation:** Comprehensive validation on all endpoints
5. **CORS:** Configured for cross-origin requests
